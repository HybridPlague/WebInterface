<p><strong>What does this server do? Why is it different than any other Siri Proxy server?</strong><br />
This server is based on the <a href="ketchup-mayo-senf.de/blog/">@kmsbueromoebel</a> proxy and <a href="https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy">Plamoni's</a> proxy.<br />
I personally thank <a href="https://twitter.com/thpryrchn">@thpryrchn</a> for guiding me in rake and gems and helping me implementing the code to Plamoni's server. </br>
This server implements a MySQL database connection for storing validation data of Siri capable Devices (4S etc).<br />
Each Key is throttled through this server enabling several client registrations and assistant object creation.</br>
This enables more clients to connect. This is also free aslong as you donate keys.<br />
